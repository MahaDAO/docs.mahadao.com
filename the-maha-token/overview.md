# Overview

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

MAHA is the governance and utility token that regulates the ARTH valuecoin, the MAHA community and other products governed by the DAO.

MAHA token holders can vote to allocate MAHA towards grants, strategic partnerships, governance initiatives, additional liquidity mining pools, and a host of other programs. The tokenomics are designed to promote self-sustaining community interest, developer engagement and ecosystem adoption.
