# Distribution & Inflation

The MAHA token is a limited supply token with no more than 10 million tokens that will ever be in circulation. A vast majority of MAHA tokens has been allocated to community and ecosystem related activities which underpins MAHA's dedication in being a coin that is governed and controlled by it's people.&#x20;

Furthermore the supply of MAHA is stretched out across a period of 10 years to ensure that token holders are as distributed and decentralised as possible. No one entity should be capable of controlling more than 1% of the supply over the course of the next few years.

On December 17th 2020, MahaDAO conducted it's very first private sale and IDO, releasing approximately 8% of the supply into circulation.

## A 10 year distribution period

The MAHA token is unique in the fact that the token is gradually released into circulation across a 10 years. This is done to ensure that the MAHA token's supply stays as evenly distributed as possible, keeping the entire protocol and the ecosystem secure from whale manipulation.&#x20;

Tokens are released into circulation through a linear distribution to ensure that there is no concentration of tokens amongst early adopters (Except for the first year when private and seed token holders are continuously vested).

_(It is estimated that by the year 3 or 4, the token distribution would be spread out as evenly possible that no one single entity will be able to control more than 1% of the MAHA supply)._

## Month by Month breakdown

For those who'd like to take precise numbers on how much MAHA will get added into the circulation, month by month, an excel sheet (linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MY3\_\_\_VHDXJc-I4mTNPFQghmVCUo4gONT882QlCSuX4/edit?usp=sharing)) has been created which goes into depth on how much new tokens get added into circulation.
