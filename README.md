# Welcome

MahaDAO is a community-powered, decentralized organization on a mission to empower billions with a stable economy through the worldâ€™s first valuecoin, [ARTH](broken-reference).

To do this, the MahaDAO uses two tokens to achieve this vision - the governance token [MAHA](the-maha-token/overview.md), and the valuecoin [ARTH](https://docs.arthcoin.com/).&#x20;

At MahaDAO, we are constantly striving to achieve the ultimate decentralized governance model. While we cannot ascertain we have achieved the perfect model, we can assure that we are on the right path and one day the Maha-DAO will be truly decentralized.&#x20;

In the next few sections of the documentation, you will find many more about the many methods MahaDAO tries to achieve decentralization, the philosophy behind MahaDAO, and ways in which you can become a contributor and join our journey.&#x20;
