# Portal Tutorials

The governance portal is the one-stop place for all `MAHA` holders to interact with the DAO, earn from it, and track other DAO members.

The governance portal is live at [gov.mahadao.com](https://gov.mahadao.com). The governance portal allows `MAHA` holders to:

* Lock their `MAHA` tokens for MAHAX
* Create new voting proposals&#x20;
* Earn platform fees
* Control the `MAHA` inflation every month
* Boost their staking rewards
* Claim their vested `MAHA` tokens

In this section, we detail a bunch of different tutorials for people who'd like to interact with this portal.
