# How to vote for your pool with a pool incentive?

Bribers try to influence the voters to decide in favor of their Liquidity Pool so that it gets a higher allocation of the rewards. In exchange, the voters are provided with another token.&#x20;

**Step 1:** You need to visit [https://gov.mahadao.com/](https://gov.mahadao.com/) and navigate to the 'pool incentive' section on the left tab.&#x20;

**Step 2:** You need to have `MAHA` to deposit into any of the pools.&#x20;

**Step 3:** Once you select the pool that you want to make the bribe for, you need to click on the **Deposit** button.&#x20;

_**NOTE:** The concept of the pool incentive works as you depositing an amount larger than the 'Total incentive' amount for the pool selected. Suppose, for example, the total incentive amount of a pool is 783 `MAHA`. Then the next user who needs an incentive for that pool needs to invest any amount more than 783 `MAHA`._&#x20;

**Step 4:** Once you have clicked on **Deposit,** you need to input an amount more than the total incentive amount and click on **Approve**.&#x20;
