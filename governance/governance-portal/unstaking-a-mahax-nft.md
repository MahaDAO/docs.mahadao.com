# Unstaking a MAHAX NFT

Unstaking a NFT allows you to transfer your NFT, list it on third party marketplaces like OpenSea or merge it with another NFT.

First step is for you to click on the ellipsis button on the top right of the NFT on the lock page and click on `"Unstake"`.&#x20;

This will be followed by a transaction confirmation  regarding the change and once you confirm the transaction you will get an update regarding that the transaction is successful.
