# Vesting

### **What Is Vesting?**

They are tokens that are held aside for some period of time for anyone who is contributing to the development of the project. Smart contracts usually lock a certain amount of funds until contract conditions are met. In other terms, the process of releasing these coins is called vesting. Vesting is usually used to show that the team is highly interested in the project, and will continue working on project development. Additionally, vesting lowers market price manipulations.&#x20;

### Why is vesting important?

Crypto is not like other markets; it's got high volatility. Massive sell-offs are also a result of a huge price increase created by the hype surrounding a new project. Retail investors create a spike in the price that early investors and the project members can then sell into, causing the price to drop and leaving the retail investors with a significant loss.

Without vesting, a single or a small number of individuals, groups can hold a significant amount of the project’s tokens from the token generation event date. This allows them the ability to quickly cause supply fluctuations that can be harmful to the token’s ecosystem and price in the long run. This would signify a huge threat to the token’s stability. Vesting, allows the given token to be distributed appropriately before any individual has this power.

Eventually, vesting is at the heart of token economics. With a vesting schedule, both public and private sale participants are protected. Above all, it ensures the long-term project’s stability and the ecosystem’s viability. It protects not only the future of a company but also the interests of those who took part in Initial Coin Offerings which include IDOs.
