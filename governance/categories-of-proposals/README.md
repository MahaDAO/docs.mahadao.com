# Categories of Proposals

## The Triage Principal

More commonly known for its use in the medical field, 'Triage' is a system of classification that helps coordinate the prioritization of response, and type of response. In a similar way, we can apply this approach to blockchain governance in order to achieve a more optimized and efficient outcome. \
\
We have created a classification system for governance proposals, each utilizing a specific governance strategy. The checklist below is used to identify the appropriate classification;&#x20;

* **CLASSIFICATION 1 - (C1):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following:
  * Nominated distribution of "Maha Emissions" via Gauge Vote
  * Inclusion/removal of "Maha Emission Gauges" (Bribes)
* **CLASSIFICATION 2 - (C2):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following;&#x20;
  * Security and Functionality of Protocol/Ecosystem Contracts
  * Partnership and Service integrations to MahaDAO
* **CLASSIFICATION 3 - (C3):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following;&#x20;
  * Treasury allocation and distribution
  * Branding & Mission Statement
  * The MahaDAO Constitution &#x20;

By utilizing proposal classifications, we can then leverage more appropriate voting strategies that better meet the needs of the community and protocol. The voting strategies are as follows;

1. **COIN WEIGHTED - Pegged to 'C1' Proposals:** Classical approach to Blockchain governance where 1 coin is equal to 1 vote. Quadratic voting is excluded in this context.
2. **DELEGATION - Pegged to 'C2' Proposals:** Expanding on 'Coin Weighted' -- Delegation introduces the capability to nominate voting power to one another.&#x20;
3. **POLLING SYSTEM - Pegged to 'C3' Proposals:** Similar to democratic elections, utilizing 1 individual as 1 vote. However, the MahaDAO Polling system does this in a way that also preserves individual privacy needs.&#x20;
