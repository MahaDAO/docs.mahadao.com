# C3 - Polling

## Expansion Points & Order

* The Revolutionary MahaDAO NFT: The team at MahaDAO has innovated a way to embed the Maha token into our MahaNFT. When a holder locks up 100+ Maha for 4 years, the protocol mints the locked asset into a unique NFT.&#x20;
* Tokenomics, Criteria, and Verification Method
  * Theory Crafting
  * Diminished Consensus VS Human Verification
  * Transparency VS Privacy

## Optimal Incentive Goals

* Treasury Management: Why Consensus Polling IS the security and quality control mechanism.
* Vision, Direction, and the MahaDAO Constitution: Ensuring that the refinement and use of alternative voting strategies for different classifications, remains as a bestowed agreement by the people and for the people.&#x20;
