# C.3 - Consensus Hybrid

### What is MahaDAO's 'Consensus Hybrid' system?

In short, we created a simple criteria for acquiring your own MahaDAO NFT -- to timelock 100 Maha for 4 years.\
\
Relative to the tokenomics and supply distribution, and in combination with the incentive model of C-1 classification proposals; there is a significantly greater probability and incentive to hold 1 (one) MahaNFT, as opposed to 2 (two) or more. This allows us to utilize the MahaDAO NFT in a way that can quantify collective preference in addition to weighted balances. \
\
The MahaDAO NFT has a unique feature that allows our Governance Power (MahaX) to be embedded into the NFT itself. \
\
With the one NFT -- we're able to facilitate a delegation vote that can (_within an acceptable threshold_) consider each participant as an individual voting entity. To understand this more in-depth, I refer to a [preliminary idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hQrexGyfG5489DGaT66XkBPWWx33b0Vuchh5xZJmQBg/edit?usp=sharing) that breaks down\


* The Revolutionary MahaDAO NFT: The team at MahaDAO have innovated a way to embed the Maha token into our MahaNFT. When a holder locks up 100+ Maha for 4 years, the protocol mints the locked asset into a unique NFT.&#x20;
