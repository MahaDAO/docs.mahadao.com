# Proposal Classifications

## Separation of Powers

\
We have created a classification system for governance proposals, each utilizing a specific governance strategy. The checklist below is used to identify the appropriate classification and governance response;&#x20;

* **CLASSIFICATION 1 - (C1):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following:
  * Nominated distribution of "Maha Emissions" via Gauge Vote
  * Inclusion/removal of "Maha Emission Gauges" (Bribes)\

* **CLASSIFICATION 2 - (C2):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following;&#x20;
  * Security and Functionality of Protocol/Ecosystem Contracts
  * Partnership and Service integrations to MahaDAO\

* **CLASSIFICATION 3 - (C3):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following;&#x20;
  * Treasury allocation and distribution
  * The MahaDAO Constitution &#x20;

By utilizing proposal classifications, we can then leverage more appropriate voting strategies that better meet the needs of the community and protocol. The voting strategies are as follows;

1. <mark style="color:red;">**COIN WEIGHTED - Pegged to 'C1' Proposals**</mark>**:** Classical approach to Blockchain governance where 1 coin is equal to 1 vote. Quadratic voting is excluded in this context.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**DELEGATION - Pegged to 'C2' Proposals**</mark>**:** Expanding on 'Coin Weighted' -- Delegation introduces the capability to nominate voting power to one another.&#x20;
3. <mark style="color:green;">**CONSENSUS HYBRID - Pegged to 'C3' Proposals**</mark>**:** Expanding on 'Delegation' -- Our hybrid model introduces an additional layer of consensus, utilizing our unique MahaNFT. This is achieved while maintaining privacy needs with no human verification required.&#x20;
