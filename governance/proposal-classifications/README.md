# Proposal Classifications

To understand the various kinds of proposals that can get executed into the DAO, we have created a classification system for governance proposals, each utilizing a specific governance strategy.&#x20;

The checklist below is used to identify the appropriate classification and governance response;&#x20;

* **CLASSIFICATION 1 - (C1):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following:
  * Nominated distribution of "MAHA Emissions" via gauge voting
  * Inclusion/removal of "MAHA Emission Gauges" (Including Bribes)\

* **CLASSIFICATION 2 - (C2):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following;&#x20;
  * Security and Functionality of Protocol/Ecosystem Contracts
  * Partnership and Service integrations to MahaDAO\

* **CLASSIFICATION 3 - (C3):** The Proposal may impact any or all of the following;&#x20;
  * Treasury allocation and distribution
  * The MahaDAO Constitution &#x20;

By utilizing proposal classifications, we can then leverage more appropriate voting strategies that better meet the needs of the community and protocol. The voting strategies are as follows;

1. [**COIN WEIGHTED - Pegged to 'C1' Proposals**](c1-coin-voting.md)**:** Classical approach to Blockchain governance where 1 coin is equal to 1 vote. Quadratic voting is excluded in this context.
2. [**DELEGATION - Pegged to 'C2' Proposals:**](c2-delegation.md) Expanding on 'Coin Weighted' -- Delegation introduces the capability to nominate voting power to one another.&#x20;
3. [**CONSENSUS HYBRID - Pegged to 'C3' Proposals**](c3-consensus-hybrid.md)**:** Expanding on 'Delegation' -- A hybrid model that introduces an additional layer of consensus, utilizing our unique MahaNFT. This is achieved while maintaining privacy needs with no human verification required.&#x20;
