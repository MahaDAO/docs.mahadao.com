# C3 - Consensus Hybrid

### What is MahaDAO's 'Consensus Hybrid' system?

Our system uses a standard delegation vote, that instead leverages the MahaDAO NFT as the voting participant. The MahaDAO NFT has a unique feature that allows our Governance Power (MAHAX) to be embedded into the NFT itself. Governance power (MAHAX), is acquired by first time-locking '`MAHA`' for a fixed duration. When someone locks up `100 Maha` for `4 years,` the protocol will mint this into a unique NFT. \
\
With the one NFT, we're not only able to facilitate a standard delegation vote, but also a tally count of the NFTs.  The NFT tally count is then (_within an acceptable threshold_) considered as an individual voting entity. To understand the relevance of the NFT criteria, please refer to this [preliminary idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hQrexGyfG5489DGaT66XkBPWWx33b0Vuchh5xZJmQBg/edit?usp=sharing) for improving consensus with weighted governance. \
\
Relative to the tokenomics and supply distribution, and in combination with the incentive model of C-1 classification proposals; there is a significantly greater advantage and incentive to hold 1 (one) MahaNFT, as opposed to 2 (two) or more. This allows us to utilize the MahaDAO NFT in a way that can quantify collective preference in addition to weighted balances. \

**Two-Factor Majority (2FM)**, a 'Pass' requires both a majority coin weighting and a majority of participating NFTs to approve the C.3 classification proposal. While there is the possibility for a single voter to hold multiple MahaDAO NFTs, the induced difficulty through locking and cost makes this a less likely occurrence to see. In addition, the incentives built around C.1 proposals have the added effect of encouraging whales to concentrate power into a single NFT. We can further build more incentives around this behavior, yet as it is the minimum criteria and is sufficient at yielding a statistically significant measure of collective and individual consensus.  \
