# C1 - Coin Voting

### What is Coin Voting?

There are many definitions and refinements around this particular approach - quadradic voting, and delegation methods that utilize a coin weighted vote. Within context, we're referencing the calculation of **'1 coin = 1 vote'** (excluding delegation).&#x20;

### Theory&#x20;

Arguably, the 'Free-Market' is a form of governance that is 'fiat-weighted' via shareholder and consumer preference. Generally speaking, traditional shareholders maintain a prerogative of maximizing profit, and the company or corporation is beholden to that goal. As a bi-product, philanthropy is seldom demonstrated beyond a marketing context.&#x20;

What we have witnessed is capitalism and the free market become undermined by bailouts and artificial value. The rules of the game have been fundamentally changed, and quite literally through monetary policy. This has lead to a moral hazard that has diminish public trust with government institutions.&#x20;

### Limitations

It's important to understand that we're opportunistic creatures, and so great diligence is required in order to design the right strategy for the intended outcome. The issue here is not profit-seeking -- but rather when that purpose undermines broader consensus on all other matters. \

As written in the following [article](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) by Vitalik, he references many of the pitfalls of coin-voting; vote buying, malicious governance attacks, and token centralization. In our view, giving complete governance power to coin-voting runs the risk of creating a plutocracy and centralizing supply. This impact however can be mitigated through adequate dispersion of the supply among holders.

### C.1 - Proposal Applications

_CLASSIFICATION 1 - (C.1) The Proposal may impact any or all of the following;_ \
_1. Nominated distribution of "MAHA Emissions" via Gauge Vote_\
_2. Inclusion/removal of "MAHA Emission Gauges" (Bribes)_\
__\
_**`C.1 Proposals will exclusively use coin-weighted voting; exclude the use of delegation.`**_

We've identified the similarities between shareholder theory and coin-weighted voting, and so this guides us to limit proposal application to profit-gearing matters. In this way, the behavior that is incentivized has a positive impact on the protocol. For example;

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Gauge & Emission Proposals**</mark>\
  ****As Maha has a reducing inflation rate over ten years, a specific amount of this is allocated for liquidity pools within the ecosystem. Here it is ideal to implement a coin voting strategy that helps leverage buying demand; this in turn counters the inflation aspect of `MAHA`, and instead _produces more scarcity as voters are required to time-lock `MAHA` into MAHAX for voting power_.&#x20;

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Gratuities (AKA 'Bribes') Proposals**</mark>\
  In this use case, external projects bid for inclusion into the MahaDAO ecosystem. In effect, expanding the farming options for liquidity pools. As with emission votes, new pools are also eligible to receive `MAHA` emissions as rewards. For the same considerations above, it makes sense to again use a coin-weighted strategy to induce more scarcity and demand.&#x20;
