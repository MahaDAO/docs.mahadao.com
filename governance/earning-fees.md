# Earning Fees & Rewards

To incentivize participants to stake into the MahaDAO ecosystem, the governance portal allows stakers to claim fees based on  their user activity.

Some fees can be earned by being passive participants in the ecosystem, whereas some fees require more active participation from DAO members.

There are four kinds of fees/incentives that members receive.

* **Inflation Rewards:** This is primarily in MAHA. From the monthly MAHA inflation, `5000 MAHA` is set aside to be distributed to all MAHA stakers.&#x20;
* **Fees from Protocol:** This is primarily in ETH & ARTH. Revenue generated from the various products from the protocol will be distributed back to the DAO members.
* **Rewards from Voting:** This is primarily in MAHA. To incentives voter participation, `1000 MAHA` every month is set aside. To learn more, read [voting rewards](delegation-and-voting-rewards.md).
* **Rewards from Pool incentives:** This would be in various other tokens. Projects and DAOs that aim to look at incentive MAHA voters to vote for their pools can as pay DAO members, rewards in their own tokens in return for the DAO's the voting power. To learn more, read [pool incentives](pool-incentives.md).

The table below gives a brief summary of what kind of activities receive what kind of rewards.

> In general, participants that are the most active in the DAO, will get the most amount of rewards.&#x20;

Some rewards can be delegated (such as the voting rewards), whereas other rewards can be earned passively without doing anything besides just having their MAHAX staked (Inflation Rewards & Protocol fees).
