# Pool Incentives

`Pool Incentives` (otherwise commonly known as Bribes or [DeFi Bribes](https://decrypt.co/90276/defi-bribes-are-on-the-rise)) is a secondary marketplace for users looking to capture `MAHAX` voting power in return for token rewards.

With `Pool Incentives`, `MAHAX NFT` holders are given token rewards by Incentivizers who pay out token rewards for a particular pool.

Any token can be deposited as an incentive for `MAHAX NFT` holders. However to create a `Pool Incentive` for a new pool, it first needs to be whitelisted and then added into the BaseVoter contract via [Governance](../creating-voting-on-proposals.md).&#x20;

## FAQs

### Will I still receive bribe rewards if I have delegated my voting power?

While we do encourage inactive participants to delegate their voting power to more active participants, the distribution of rewards as of now cannot be delegated if the votes have been delegated.

That is, if you have delegated your voting power to a delegate and that delegate votes for a pool that has an active bribe, all rewards go to the delegate instead to you. It is up to the delegate to distribute the bribes pro-actively to you.

_(Future implementations of governance will find ways to distribute bribes properly to users who have delegated their power)._
