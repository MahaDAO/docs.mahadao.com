# Coordinape for Payouts

Every month, the MahaDAO Ecosystem gets 50,000 MAHA tokens to spend on various ecosystem activities. For the first month, the budget allocated to the Coordinape platform will be 5,000 MAHA tokens per month. Post the first month, the budget will scale slowly up to a maximum of 15,000 MAHA tokens per month based on the growth of the DAO.

[Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) is a platform initially developed by the Yearn Finance team for organising payouts and bringing transparency to how the DAOs operated.

With Coordinape, coordinating and incentivizing various members within the MahaDAO community becomes as simple as a few button clicks \(even at scale\).

Every member within the platform gets a budget of MAHA tokens every month using which he/she can reward other community members in the platform for their contributions. Community members can also leave reasons as to why he/she has decided to reward a community member a certain amount giving an extra level of transparency.

## Using the Community Graph to Understand Payouts and Eliminating Cartels <a id="d8f7"></a>

To avoid situations where members attempt to create cartels and try to reward each other with no active contribution to the DAO, the Coordinape tool offers a graph view to visualise the entire contribution network.

The graph is a visual representation of how rewards flow from one member to another. Because of its nature, it can easily help identify cartels by observing circles of users who keep rewarding each other.

This brings a deep level of transparency that otherwise would be impossible.
