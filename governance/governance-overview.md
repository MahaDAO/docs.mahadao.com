# Governance Overview

MahaDAO's governance model is designed to keep malicious attackers out of the way and ensure that the project is kept to be as decentralized as possible.

The model described in this section is designed takes inspiration from best practices from various protocols in creating a governance structure that is:

* Meant to be as decentralized as possible
* Allows for delegation to encourage high voter participation
* Has a time-lock to ensure that malicious proposals can get rejected/veto'd in time.

Besides just securing the protocol, governance participants also get additional benefits such as:

* [Voting and earning from pool incentives](pool-incentives.md)
* [Earning fees from the protocol](earning-fees-and-rewards.md)
* [Boosting their farming rewards](boosting-staking-rewards.md)

MahaDAO's governance has various components to it, each of it briefly explained below.
