# MAHAX Staking

Why Introduce MAHAX?

* Allocate voting power to long-term holders of MAHA through MAHAX.
* Allow MAHAX holders to partake in earning fees from the ecosystem.
* Allow MAHAX holders to safely and securely control the inflation of MAHA tokens.
* All ecosystem benefits \(Incubate project private sale, Oracle participation, etc, etc…\)

## How does it work?

* Lock MAHA between 1 week to 4 years to receive MAHAX.
* MAHAX becomes non-transferable and non-tradeable.
* 1 MAHAX = 1 vote in the future of MAHA governance, validators, airdrops, etc…
* MAHAX staked translates to voting power which can be used to determine the allocation of MAHA token liquidity mining by chain and market.

### Assuming 1000 MAHA is locked

| 63.7 | 3 month |
| 21.23 | 1 month |
| 4.79 | 1 week |
