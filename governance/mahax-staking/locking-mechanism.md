# Locking Mechanism

With MAHAX we get the power to vote for the proposals. The longer you lock your MAHA for, the more voting power you have \(and the bigger boost you can reach\).  
How vote locking works?  
MAHA holders can vote lock their MAHA into the MAHA DAO to receive MAHAX. The longer they lock for, the more MAHAX they receive. Vote locking allows you to vote in governance.  
The number of MAHAX you will receive depends on how long you lock your MAHA for. The minimum locking time is one week and the maximum locking time is four years. Your MAHAX weight gradually decreases as your escrowed tokens approach their lock expiry.  
If more people vote lock your boost will stay what it was when you applied it.
