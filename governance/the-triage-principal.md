# The Triage Principal

More commonly known for it's use in the medical field; 'Triage' is a system of classification that helps coordinate the prioritization of response, and type of response. In a similar way, we can apply this approach to blockchain governance in order to achieve a more optimized and efficient outcome. \
\
We have created a classification system for governance proposals, each utilizing a specific governance strategy. The checklist below is used to identify the appropriate classification; \


\
CLASSIFICATION 1 - (C-1)\
The Proposal may impact any or all of the following; \
\-- Nominated distribution of "Maha Emissions" via Gauge Vote\
\-- Inclusion/removal of "Maha Emission Gauges" (Bribes)\


CLASSIFICATION 2 - **** (C-2)\
The Proposal may impact any or all of the following; \
\-- Security and Functionality of Protocol/Ecosystem Contracts\
\-- Partnership and Service integrations to MahaDAO

\
CLASSIFICATION 3 - (C-3)\
The Proposal may impact any or all of the following; \
\-- Treasury allocation and distribution\
\-- Branding & Mission Statement\
\-- The MahaDAO Constitution  \


\
By utilizing proposal classifications, we can then leverage more appropriate voting strategies that better meet the needs of the community and protocol. The voting strategies are as follows;\
\
\
1\. COIN WEIGHTED  - Pegged to 'C1' Proposals\
Classical approach to Blockchain governance where 1 coin is equal to 1 vote. Quadradic voting is excluded in this context.\


2\. DELEGATION - Pegged to 'C2' Proposals\
Expanding on 'Coin Weighted' -- Delegation introduces the capability to nominate voting power to one another. \


3\. POLLING SYSTEM - Pegged to 'C3' Proposals\
Similar to democratic elections, utilizing 1 individual as 1 vote. However, the MahaDAO Polling system does this in a way that also preserves individual privacy needs. \
