# Joining the DAO

DAO members are contributors who actively participate in discussion and to the growth of the DAO. Becoming a DAO member is a very simple process. We've ensured that the jour decentralised, organised and seamless as possible.

To become a DAO member, all you have to do is:

* Fill in this application form, giving information about what you can contribute and how you can bring value to the ecosystem.
* Get approved by the community through a governance vote.

## Why become a DAO member?

The biggest benefit of becoming a DAO member is that you will get paid in MAHA tokens for the activities that you'll do to promote the ecosystem and the community.

Every month 5,000 MAHA tokens is allocated to be used by DAO members for various activities that can be used to promote the ecosystem. 

## Keeping the process fair and decentralised

Since DAOs no C-level executives, no board members or any other kind of top-down hierarchies of control, it is the community that gets decides who becomes a DAO member and who is removed from the DAO.

Every week, existing DAO members will go through all the new applicants and asses who is eligible for MAHA payouts for their contributions. Applicants who are approved by existing DAO members are then informed that a vote will take place to approve their induction into the MahaDAO.

This vote will allow all MAHAX holders to decide if the applicants are eligible to be inducted into the DAO or not. After all, MAHA is a community driven by the people. 

Finally, after the vote has gone through, the new applicants are now added into the DAO and will start receiving payouts in MAHA for their contributions.

_\(At the initial stages, DAO members will review applicants once every week. As the DAO grows, the review period will extend to a month to accommodate newer members\)._
