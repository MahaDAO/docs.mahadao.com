# Revenue Share

The MahaDAO ecosystem has various sources of revenue which get collected at a single place and get distributed across various parties.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
All fees get accumulated to the `FeeSplitter` contract which is deployed at [0x9032f1bd0cc645fde1b41941990da85f265a7623](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9032f1bd0cc645fde1b41941990da85f265a7623)
{% endhint %}

Revenue comes from the following channels:

1. **Uniswap / Curve Trading Fees:** All LP tokens and NFT positions staked in one of the various MAHA gauges transfers the trading fees earned to the DAO. Trading fees earned from Uniswap V3 is 1% on every trade.
2. **Opensea, NFT Marketplace Royalties:** All NFT marketplaces charge a creator fee for every sale of NFTs that happen on the protocol. This creator fee is currently set at 5-10%.
3. **MahaLend Fees**: Users that borrow ARTH from the MahaLend protocol pay a borrowing interest in the form of ARTH. This interest is split between lenders and to the DAO.
4. **ARTH Redemptions:** Any time a user redeems ARTH for the underlying ETH from an active loan, a 0.5% redeemption fee is charged in ARTH.

To get a deeper idea of the various sources of revenue, we have prepared a Dune dashboard that showcases this information.

### How Revenue Gets Distributed

Once revenue gets collected from the `FeeSplitter` contract it then gets sent onto various different sources to grow the protocol.
